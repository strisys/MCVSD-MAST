# Mean

To solve problems involving the **mean** (average), it is helpful to remember this core concept:

- Removing a value **higher** than the current mean will **decrease** the mean.
- Removing a value **lower** than the current mean will **increase** the mean.
- Removing a value **equal** to the mean will leave the mean **unchanged**.

Here are three practice problems focusing on how specific data points influence the mean of a set.

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Test Scores

A teacher is looking at the test scores for a small study group. The scores are: $\{72, 75, 78, 80, 85, 90, 100\}$. The current mean score is **82.8**. Which score, if removed from the set, would result in the **highest increase** in the mean for the remaining students?

- A. $100$
- B. $85$
- C. $80$
- D. $72$

### Problem 2: Temperature Trends

The scatterplot below shows the recorded high temperatures for a city over a 7-day period. The horizontal blue line represents the **mean temperature** of $74^\circ\text{F}$.

Which data point, when removed, would **decrease** the mean temperature?

- A. Day 3: $(3, 68)$
- B. Day 4: $(4, 74)$
- C. Day 5: $(5, 82)$
- D. Day 1: $(1, 70)$

### Problem 3: Production Output

A factory tracks the number of units produced by 5 different machines. The data is shown in the table below:

| **Machine ID** | **Units Produced** |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Machine A      | 150                |
| Machine B      | 210                |
| Machine C      | 190                |
| Machine D      | 180                |
| Machine E      | 270                |

The mean production is **200 units**. If the goal is to have a remaining mean that is **greater than 200**, which machine's data should be removed?

- A. Machine E
- B. Machine B
- C. Machine A
- D. Machine C
