# Mean

To calculate the mean from a frequency table, you multiply each **Value** by its **Frequency** to find the total sum, then divide by the **Total Frequency** (the number of students).

The correct answer for your image was 7.3 because:

$\text{Mean} = \frac{(5 \times 5) + (6 \times 1) + (7 \times 4) + (8 \times 5) + (9 \times 6)}{5 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 6} = \frac{153}{21} \approx 7.285$

### Practice Question 1: Survey Results

A group of students was asked how many books they read over the summer. The results are shown in the table below. What is the **mean** number of books read? (Round to the nearest tenth).

| **Books Read (Value)** | **Number of Students (Frequency)** |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1                      | 3                                  |
| 2                      | 6                                  |
| 3                      | 8                                  |
| 4                      | 3                                  |

Answer: Total sum: $(1 \times 3) + (2 \times 6) + (3 \times 8) + (4 \times 3) = 3 + 12 + 24 + 12 = 51$

Total students: $3 + 6 + 8 + 3 = 20$

$\text{Mean} = \frac{51}{20} = \mathbf{2.6}$

### Practice Question 2: Daily Rainfall

A meteorologist recorded the amount of rainfall (in inches) over 10 days. Find the **mean** daily rainfall.

| **Rainfall (Value)** | **Days (Frequency)** |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0                    | 4                    |
| 1                    | 2                    |
| 2                    | 3                    |
| 5                    | 1                    |

### Practice Question 3: Quiz Scores

A small class took a 10-point quiz. The distribution of scores is listed below. What is the **mean** score for the class? (Round to the nearest tenth).

| **Quiz Score (Value)** | **Number of Students (Frequency)** |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 7                      | 2                                  |
| 8                      | 5                                  |
| 9                      | 4                                  |
| 10                     | 1                                  |
