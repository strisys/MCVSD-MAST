To calculate the mean from a frequency table, you multiply each **Value** by its **Frequency** to find the total sum, then divide by the **Total Frequency** (the number of students).

### Question 1

Answer: Total sum: $(1 \times 3) + (2 \times 6) + (3 \times 8) + (4 \times 3) = 3 + 12 + 24 + 12 = 51$
Total students: $3 + 6 + 8 + 3 = 20$
$\text{Mean} = \frac{51}{20} = \mathbf{2.6}$

### Question 2

Answer: Total sum: $(0 \times 4) + (1 \times 2) + (2 \times 3) + (5 \times 1) = 0 + 2 + 6 + 5 = 13$
Total days: $4 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 10$
$\text{Mean} = \frac{13}{10} = \mathbf{1.3}$

### Question 3

Answer: Total sum: $(7 \times 2) + (8 \times 5) + (9 \times 4) + (10 \times 1) = 14 + 40 + 36 + 10 = 100$
Total students: $2 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 12$
$\text{Mean} = \frac{100}{12} \approx \mathbf{8.3}$
