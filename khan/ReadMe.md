### Unit 2 

#### **Exercise 1: Rates with fractions** (difficult)

1. The mechanics of adding/subtracting fractions and multiplying/dividing fractions.  Review the rationale as to why the mechanics work this way. ([AI conversation](./ai-conversation/fraction-math.md)). Also, this was first covered in [5th-grade math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fifth-grade-math).  [Unit 4, Exercise 1](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fifth-grade-math/imp-fractions-3) has good visuals to support the concepts of adding and subtracting, and why a common denominator is necessary.

1. If two quantities are *proportional*, the constant of proportionality (or slope) can be found by dividing one quantity by the corresponding quantity, even when those values are fractions. The unit rate is simply this constant of proportionality expressed per one unit.

1. Lastly, read the question carefully because the denominator should be expressed usually in time (per minute, hour, etc) or distance (mile, km).

   

#### **Exercise: Rewriting decimals as fractions** (easy)

- Not particularly challenging, as the trick is basically to see that, say, the decimal goes to the hundredths place (e.g., 0.07) and then divide the number by 100 (e.g., 7/100).

- Sal Khan went through the following steps for the problem of expressing 2.75 as a mixed fraction.

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  &2.75 = 2 + \left(\frac{7}{10} + \frac{5}{100}\right) \\
  &2 + \left(\frac{70}{100} + \frac{5}{100}\right) \\
  &2 + \frac{75}{100} \\
  &2 + \frac{3}{4} \\
  &2\frac{3}{4}
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  
  

- **Exercise: Converting fractions to decimals** (laborious, easy)
  - For this section, come up with the best estimate and then use a calculator.  Getting the answer involves long division, and that is painful.
  - A **prime number** is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are one (1) and itself.  Using that idea, we can explain when a fraction will have a **terminating** or **repeating** decimal.  A simplified fraction will have a **terminating decimal** only when the denominator’s prime factors are **2, 5, or both**, because our base-10 system is built from (10 = 2 \times 5).  If the denominator includes **any other prime factor**, the decimal will **repeat**.
- **Exercise: Order Rational Numbers** (moderate)
  - This is a matter of comparing various numbers like fractions, mixed numbers, and decimals, and ordering them.  It’s like a composite of the previous sections to help solidify understanding.  The trick is to convert all to decimal first, then order.

#### 8.3.5 Intercepts from a graph ([exercise](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-eighth-grade-math/cc-8th-linear-equations-functions/8th-x-and-y-intercepts/e/linear-function-intercepts), easy)

- When dealing with x- and y-intercepts, the y- and x-coordinates are 0, respectively, in the ordered pair.  Set to 0 and then look at each intercept and get the values for x and y.

#### 8.3.6 Intercepts from an equation ([exercise](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-eighth-grade-math/cc-8th-linear-equations-functions/8th-x-and-y-intercepts/e/solving_for_the_x-intercept), easy)

- Again, recall that when dealing with x- and y-intercepts, the y- and x-coordinates are 0, respectively, in the ordered pair.  As such, to determine the answers to the two-variable questions given, we know that either x or y is 0, depending on the intercept in question.
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  -5x - 4y = 10\\
  \text{y-intercept} (?,?)\\
  \text{x-intercept} (?,?)\\
  \end{aligned}
  $$

#### 8.3.7 Slope from graph ([exercise](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-eighth-grade-math/cc-8th-linear-equations-functions/8th-slope/e/slope-from-a-graph), difficult)

- Remember, slope is rise ($$\Delta{y}$$) / run ($$\Delta{x}$$).  Since they are showing a graph, create a triangle at a point on the graph where both x and y are whole numbers, if possible, and then take the ratio of y given x.  Its essential to note you can test the answer by multiplying the slope by x to get y and looking at the graph to see if it makes sense.

#### 8.3.8 Slope from two points ([exercise](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-eighth-grade-math/cc-8th-linear-equations-functions/8th-slope/e/slope-from-two-points), easy)

- Take the two coordinates, determine $$\Delta{y}$$ and $$\Delta{x}$$, and take the ratio of $$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$.
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  (-9,6)\space\text{and}\space(-6,-9)\\
  \Delta{x} = -6 - (-9) = 3\\ 
  \Delta{y} = -9 - 6 = -15\\
  \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-15}{3} = -5
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  

#### 8.3.9 Slope from equation ([exercise](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-eighth-grade-math/cc-8th-linear-equations-functions/8th-slope/e/slope-from-an-equation-in-standard-form))
