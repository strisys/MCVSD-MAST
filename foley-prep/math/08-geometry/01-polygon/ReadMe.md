# Geometry / Polygons

Certainly! Here are the questions from your image along with five new ones, adapted into an open-ended format.

### **MCVSD Practice Set: Geometry & Measurement**

### Problem 1

Lisa takes the number of sides in a decagon, then divides it by one fewer than the number of sides in a hexagon. What is the resulting number?

### Problem 2

What is the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with 17 sides? (Recall that the sum of interior angles in a polygon of $n$ sides is $(n - 2)180^{\circ}$).

### Problem 3

You need to paint a rectangular wall that is 8 feet wide and 6 feet tall. Each gallon of paint covers 200 square feet of wall. How many gallons of paint do you need if you want to apply two coats? (Express your answer as a fraction in simplest form).

### Problem 4

A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. If the height is doubled and the width is halved while the length remains the same, what is the volume of the new prism in cubic centimeters?

### Problem 5

A standard stop sign is a regular octagon. Calculate the measure of exactly one interior angle of a regular octagon in degrees.

### Problem 6

A cylindrical water tank has a radius of 3 feet and a height of 7 feet. Using $\pi \approx \frac{22}{7}$, calculate the approximate volume of the tank in cubic feet.

### Problem 7

The area of a square is 144 square inches. If the length of each side of the square is increased by 25%, what is the area of the new, larger square in square inches?

### Problem 8

The ratio of the side lengths of two similar triangles is 3:4. If the area of the smaller triangle is 18 square units, what is the area of the larger triangle in square units?
