# Mean

To master how specific data points affect the **mean**, remember these three simple rules:

1. **Removing a point ABOVE the mean** pulls the average **down** (decreases the mean).
2. **Removing a point BELOW the mean** pushes the average **up** (increases the mean).
3. **The further a point is from the mean**, the greater the impact its removal will have.

Here are three practice problems using scatterplots.

### Problem 1: Increasing the Mean

The scatterplot below shows the test scores of six students. The horizontal dashed line represents the current mean score of approximately $80.8$.

Which data point, when removed, would result in the **largest increase** in the mean score of the remaining students?

- A. $(4, 95)$
- B. $(2, 88)$
- C. $(5, 60)$
- D. $(3, 75)$

### Problem 2: Decreasing the Mean

The scatterplot below shows daily rainfall recorded over a 5-day period. The horizontal dashed line represents the mean rainfall of $20.0 \text{ mm}$.

Which data point, when removed, would **decrease** the mean rainfall for the period?

- A. $(1, 12)$
- B. $(3, 45)$
- C. $(4, 10)$
- D. $(5, 18)$

### Problem 3: Impact Magnitude

The scatterplot below shows the delivery times for six different orders. The horizontal dashed line represents the mean delivery time of $35.0 \text{ minutes}$.

Which data point, when removed, would cause the **mean to decrease the most**?

- A. $(5, 60)$
- B. $(2, 32)$
- C. $(6, 29)$
- D. $(3, 28)$
