# Arithmetic / Order of Operations

### Learning Aid: PEMDAS Hierarchy

For these problems, always refer to the order of operations. When you see a fraction bar, solve the entire top and the entire bottom completely before doing the final division.

1. Complex Fraction Evaluation

Evaluate the following:

$$\frac{4 + (5 \times 2) - 6}{(2 + 2^2) - (1 \times 4)}$$

2. Algebraic Word Problem

Leo has $60. He wants to buy several packs of trading cards. Each pack costs $8. He also buys a protective case for $12. After buying $n$ packs of cards and 1 case, he has $16 left over. How many packs of cards did Leo purchase?

3. Mixed Operations

Evaluate the following expression:

$$12 + 3 \times (8 - 5)^2 \div 9$$

4. Fractions and Exponents

Evaluate the following expression:

$$\frac{(12 \div 3)^2 - 10}{(6 \div 12)^2 \times 24}$$

5. Nested Grouping

Evaluate the following expression:

$$[(15 - 3) \div 4]^3 + 2 \times 5$$

6. Evaluating Complex Fractions

Evaluate the following expression:

$$\frac{20 - (4^2 - 1)}{(3 \times 2) - 1}$$

7. Multi-Step Word Problem

Marcus has $100. He buys 3 video games that cost $x each and a controller for $40. After these purchases, he has $15 remaining. What is the cost ($x) of one video game?

8. Order of Operations with Exponents

Evaluate the following expression:

$$10^2 \div (2 + 3) \times 4 - 50$$

9. Fraction Comparison and Operations

Evaluate the following expression:

$$\frac{(15 \div 5)^2 + 1}{(2 \div 4)^2 \times 8}$$

10. Nested Operations

Evaluate the following expression:

$$5 \times [24 \div (10 - 2)] + 3^2$$
