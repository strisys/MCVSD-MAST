# Percent

To solve the problem in the image, you first identify that the ratio $2:3:5$ represents the relative sizes of the three angles. Since 2 is the smallest part of the ratio, it corresponds to the smallest angle of **30°**.

1. **Find the value of one "part":** Divide the smallest angle by its ratio part: $30 \div 2 = 15$. So, 1 part = **15°**.
2. **Calculate the second angle:** Multiply the second ratio part by the value of one part: $3 \times 15 = \mathbf{45^\circ}$.
3. **Calculate the third angle:** Multiply the third ratio part by the value of one part: $5 \times 15 = \mathbf{75^\circ}$.

The correct answer is **A. 45°, 75°**.

### Answer Key

| **Problem** | **Answer**    | **Calculation Hint**              |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **1**       | **420 books** | $1200 \times 0.35 = 420$          |
| **2**       | **$92**       | $80 + (80 \times 0.15) = 80 + 12$ |
| **3**       | **$760**      | $950 \times 0.80 = 760$           |
| **4**       | **84%**       | $(42 \div 50) \times 100 = 84$    |
| **5**       | **$300,000**  | $9000 \div 0.03 = 300,000$        |

Certainly! Here are the step-by-step solutions for each of the percent problems.

### 1. Simple Percent of a Number

**Problem:** A local library has 1,200 books. If 35% of the books are non-fiction, how many non-fiction books does the library have?

- **Step 1:** Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 ($35\% = 0.35$).
- **Step 2:** Multiply the total number of books by the decimal.
- **Calculation:** $1200 \times 0.35 = 420$
- **Answer:** **420 books**

------

### 2. Percent Increase

**Problem:** A pair of sneakers originally cost $80. The price was increased by 15% due to high demand. What is the new price of the sneakers?

- **Step 1:** Find the amount of the increase by multiplying the original price by 15%.
  - $80 \times 0.15 = 12$
- **Step 2:** Add the increase to the original price.
  - $80 + 12 = 92$
- **Alternative Method:** Multiply the original price by 1.15 ($100\% + 15\%$).
  - $80 \times 1.15 = 92$
- **Answer:** **$92**

------

### 3. Percent Decrease (Sale)

**Problem:** A laptop is on sale for 20% off its original price of $950. What is the sale price of the laptop before tax?

- **Step 1:** Calculate the discount amount.
  - $950 \times 0.20 = 190$
- **Step 2:** Subtract the discount from the original price.
  - $950 - 190 = 760$
- **Alternative Method:** If the discount is 20%, you are paying 80% of the price.
  - $950 \times 0.80 = 760$
- **Answer:** **$760**

------

### 4. Finding the Percent

**Problem:** A student answered 42 out of 50 questions correctly on a math test. What percentage did the student receive on the test?

- **Step 1:** Create a fraction of "part over whole."
  - $\frac{42}{50}$
- **Step 2:** Divide the top number by the bottom number to get a decimal.
  - $42 \div 50 = 0.84$
- **Step 3:** Multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage.
  - $0.84 \times 100 = 84\%$
- **Answer:** **84%**

------

### 5. Reverse Percent (Finding the Whole)

**Problem:** A real estate agent earned a 3% commission on the sale of a house. If the agent's commission was $9,000, what was the total selling price of the house?

- **Step 1:** Identify the formula for the Whole: $\text{Whole} = \text{Part} \div \text{Percent (as a decimal)}$.
- **Step 2:** Convert 3% to a decimal ($0.03$).
- **Step 3:** Divide the commission (the part) by the decimal rate.
  - $9000 \div 0.03 = 300,000$
- **Answer:** **$300,000**
