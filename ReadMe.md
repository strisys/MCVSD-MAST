# **Language Arts Section (15 Questions)**

Read the passage and answer Questions 1–7:

---

## **Passage**

*The ocean is home to an enormous variety of life, from microscopic plankton to Earth’s largest mammals. Scientists estimate that more than 80% of the ocean remains unexplored, which means countless species could still be undiscovered. In recent years, advances in underwater robotics have allowed researchers to dive deeper than ever before. These robotic vehicles can withstand extreme pressure and collect samples from places that humans cannot reach. As a result, our understanding of ocean ecosystems is rapidly expanding. However, with climate change and pollution threatening these environments, many scientists stress the importance of protecting ocean habitats before some species disappear forever.*
