# Mean

To master how specific data points affect the **mean**, remember these three simple rules:

1. **Removing a point ABOVE the mean** pulls the average **down** (decreases the mean).
2. **Removing a point BELOW the mean** pushes the average **up** (increases the mean).
3. **The further a point is from the mean**, the greater the impact its removal will have.

Here are three practice problems using scatterplots.

### Problem 1: Increasing the Mean

The scatterplot below shows the test scores of six students. The horizontal dashed line represents the current mean score of approximately $80.8$.

Which data point, when removed, would result in the **largest increase** in the mean score of the remaining students?

- A. $(4, 95)$
- B. $(2, 88)$
- C. $(5, 60)$
- D. $(3, 75)$

### Problem 2: Decreasing the Mean

The scatterplot below shows daily rainfall recorded over a 5-day period. The horizontal dashed line represents the mean rainfall of $20.0 \text{ mm}$.

Which data point, when removed, would **decrease** the mean rainfall for the period?

- A. $(1, 12)$
- B. $(3, 45)$
- C. $(4, 10)$
- D. $(5, 18)$

### Problem 3: Impact Magnitude

The scatterplot below shows the delivery times for six different orders. The horizontal dashed line represents the mean delivery time of $35.0 \text{ minutes}$.

Which data point, when removed, would cause the **mean to decrease the most**?

- A. $(5, 60)$
- B. $(2, 32)$
- C. $(6, 29)$
- D. $(3, 28)$

## Answer Key and Explanations

### Solution 1: C

- **Reasoning:** To **increase** the mean, you must remove a value that is *below* the current mean. While both $(3, 75)$ and $(5, 60)$ are below the mean line, $(5, 60)$ is much further away. Removing the lowest "outlier" pulls the remaining average up significantly.

### Solution 2: B

- **Reasoning:** To **decrease** the mean, you must remove a value that is *above* the current mean. In this dataset, only one point—$(3, 45)$—is above the mean line. Removing this high value will leave only the lower values, causing the average to drop.

### Solution 3: A

- **Reasoning:** To cause a **decrease** in the mean, you must remove a point above the mean. To cause the **largest** decrease, you must remove the point that is the *furthest* above the mean. The point $(5, 60)$ is the highest point on the graph and significantly higher than the mean of $35$, so its removal has the greatest downward impact.
