# Percent

To solve the problem in the image, you first identify that the ratio $2:3:5$ represents the relative sizes of the three angles. Since 2 is the smallest part of the ratio, it corresponds to the smallest angle of **30°**.

1. **Find the value of one "part":** Divide the smallest angle by its ratio part: $30 \div 2 = 15$. So, 1 part = **15°**.
2. **Calculate the second angle:** Multiply the second ratio part by the value of one part: $3 \times 15 = \mathbf{45^\circ}$.
3. **Calculate the third angle:** Multiply the third ratio part by the value of one part: $5 \times 15 = \mathbf{75^\circ}$.

The correct answer is **A. 45°, 75°**.
