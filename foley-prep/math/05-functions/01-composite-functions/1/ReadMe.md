# Composite Functions



To solve the problem in your image, you need to use **composite functions**. The goal is to evaluate the inner function first, and then use that result as the input for the outer function.

Here are three similar problems designed to help you practice this substitution and evaluation process.

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Linear and Quadratic Mix

If $f(x) = 3x - 4$ and $g(x) = \frac{x^2 - 10}{x + 2}$, find the value of $g(f(3))$.

### Problem 2: Radical and Rational Mix

If $h(x) = \sqrt{x + 5}$ and $j(x) = \frac{2x^2 - 4}{x - 1}$, find the value of $j(h(11))$.

### Problem 3: Higher Degree Polynomials

If $p(x) = x^2 - 1$ and $q(x) = \frac{x^2 - 5x + 6}{x - 4}$, find the value of $q(p(3))$.
