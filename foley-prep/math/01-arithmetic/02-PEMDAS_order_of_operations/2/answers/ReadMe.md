### Answer Key & Step-by-Step Solutions

| **Problem** | **Answer** | **Step-by-Step Breakdown**                                   |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1**       | **4**      | **Num:** $4 + 10 - 6 = 8$. **Denom:** $(2 + 4) - 4 = 2$. **Final:** $8 / 2 = 4$. |
| **2**       | **4**      | Start with $60$. Subtract the case: $60 - 12 = 48$. He has $16$ left, so he spent $48 - 16 = 32$ on cards. $32 \div 8 = 4$. |
| **3**       | **15**     | **Parentheses:** $(3)^2 = 9$. **Multiply/Divide:** $3 \times 9 \div 9 = 3$. **Add:** $12 + 3 = 15$. |
| **4**       | **1**      | **Num:** $4^2 - 10 = 6$. **Denom:** $(0.5)^2 \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6$. **Final:** $6 / 6 = 1$. |
| **5**       | **37**     | **Brackets:** $(12 \div 4) = 3$. **Exponent:** $3^3 = 27$. **Add:** $27 + (2 \times 5) = 37$. |
| **6**       | **1**      | **Num:** $20 - (16 - 1) = 5$. **Denom:** $6 - 1 = 5$. **Final:** $5 \div 5 = 1$. |
| **7**       | **$15**    | Total spent: $100 - 15 = 85$. Subtract controller: $85 - 40 = 45$. Divide by 3 games: $45 \div 3 = 15$. |
| **8**       | **30**     | **Exponent:** $100$. **Divide:** $100 \div 5 = 20$. **Multiply:** $20 \times 4 = 80$. **Subtract:** $80 - 50 = 30$. |
| **9**       | **5**      | **Num:** $3^2 + 1 = 10$. **Denom:** $(0.5)^2 \times 8 = 2$. **Final:** $10 \div 2 = 5$. |
| **10**      | **24**     | **Inner Parentheses:** $10 - 2 = 8$. **Brackets:** $24 \div 8 = 3$. **Solve:** $(5 \times 3) + 9 = 15 + 9 = 24$. |

### Learning Aid: PEMDAS Hierarchy

For these problems, always refer to the order of operations. When you see a fraction bar, solve the entire top and the entire bottom completely before doing the final division.
