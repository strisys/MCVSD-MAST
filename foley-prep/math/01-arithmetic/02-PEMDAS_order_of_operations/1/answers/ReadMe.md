### Solving Guide: PEMDAS Strategy

When solving these problems, always move through the hierarchy of operations. For complex fractions, treat the bar as a grouping symbol: solve the entire numerator and denominator separately before the final division.

### Answer Key & Step-by-Step Solutions

| **Problem** | **Answer** | **Step-by-Step Breakdown**                                   |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1**       | **4**      | Num: $4 + 10 - 6 = 8$; Denom: $(2 + 4) - 4 = 2$. $8 \div 2 = 4$. |
| **2**       | **4**      | $60 - 12 = 48$ (total for cards + remainder). $48 - 16 = 32$ spent on cards. $32 \div 8 = 4$. |
| **3**       | **15**     | $(3)^2 = 9$. Then: $12 + (3 \times 9 \div 9) = 12 + 3 = 15$. |
| **4**       | **1**      | Num: $4^2 - 10 = 6$; Denom: $(0.5)^2 \times 24 = 6$. $6 \div 6 = 1$. |
| **5**       | **37**     | $[12 \div 4] = 3$. Then $3^3 = 27$. Finally $27 + 10 = 37$.  |
| **6**       | **1**      | Num: $20 - 15 = 5$; Denom: $6 - 1 = 5$. $5 \div 5 = 1$.      |
| **7**       | **$15**    | $100 - 15 = 85$ spent. $85 - 40 = 45$ for games. $45 \div 3 = 15$. |
| **8**       | **30**     | $100 \div 5 \times 4 - 50 \rightarrow 20 \times 4 - 50 \rightarrow 80 - 50 = 30$. |
| **9**       | **5**      | Num: $3^2 + 1 = 10$; Denom: $0.25 \times 8 = 2$. $10 \div 2 = 5$. |
| **10**      | **24**     | $5 \times [24 \div 8] + 9 \rightarrow 5 \times 3 + 9 \rightarrow 15 + 9 = 24$. |
