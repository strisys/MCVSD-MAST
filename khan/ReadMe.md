### Unit 2 

- #### **Exercise 1: Rates with fractions** - The key to the exercise is understanding two things
  1. The mechanics of adding/subtracting fractions and multiplying/dividing fractions.  Review the rationale as to why the mechanics work this way. ([AI conversation](./ai-conversation/fraction-math.md))
  1. If two quantities are *proportional*, the constant of proportionality (or slope) can be found by dividing one quantity by the corresponding quantity, even when those values are fractions. The unit rate is simply this constant of proportionality expressed per one unit.
  1. This was first covered in [5th grade math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fifth-grade-math).  Unit 4, Exercise 1 has good visuals to support the concepts of adding and subtracting, and why a common denominator is necessary.
