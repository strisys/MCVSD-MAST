## Answer Key

| **Problem** | **Work/Logic**                                               | **Final Answer** |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **1**       | $\frac{3}{4}$ of $12$ is $9$ slices eaten. $12 - 9 = 3$      | **3 slices**     |
| **2**       | $\frac{1}{5}$ of $15$ is $3$ (the amount left). $15 - 3 = 12$ | **12 squares**   |
| **3**       | $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6}$ (which is $\frac{1}{2}$). $\frac{1}{2}$ of $24$ is $12$ | **12 cookies**   |
| **4**       | $\frac{2}{5} = 4$ sections and $\frac{1}{2} = 5$ sections. $4 + 5 = 9$ | **9 sections**   |
| **5**       | $\frac{1}{4}$ of $12$ is $3$ (the amount left). $12 - 3 = 9$ | **9 cupcakes**   |
| **6**       | $\frac{2}{10} + \frac{5}{10} = \frac{7}{10}$. $\frac{7}{10}$ of $20$ is $14$ | **14 feet**      |
| **7**       | $\frac{1}{3}$ of $18$ is $6$ (the amount left). $18 - 6 = 12$ | **12 pieces**    |
