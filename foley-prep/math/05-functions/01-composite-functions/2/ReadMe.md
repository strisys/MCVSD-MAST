# Composite Functions

To help you master finding the general expression for composite functions, here are three problems that require you to substitute the entire function $f(x)$ into $g(x)$.

This process is like a "nested" substitution: everywhere you see an $x$ in the outer function, you replace it with the entire formula of the inner function.

## Practice Problems (Algebraic Expressions)

### Problem 1

Given $f(x) = 3x - 1$ and $g(x) = \frac{x^2}{x + 5}$, find the expression for $g(f(x))$.

### Problem 2

Given $f(x) = x + 4$ and $g(x) = \frac{x^2 - 16}{x - 2}$, find the expression for $g(f(x))$ and simplify.

### Problem 3

Given $f(x) = 2x^2$ and $g(x) = \frac{x - 3}{x + 1}$, find the expression for $g(f(x))$.
